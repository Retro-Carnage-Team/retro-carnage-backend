# RETRO CARNAGE BACKEND

The goal of this project is to build a modern multi-directional scrolling shooter - a worthy successor of the classic 
1989 video game [Dogs of War](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41090) by 
[Elite Systems](http://www.elite-systems.co.uk). This is the backend part of the game. Check out the 
[frontend repository](https://github.com/huddeldaddel/retro-carnage) to find out more about the game.  

## Status

Currently, it's used to collect anonymous usage data that can hopefully help to
identify software bugs and usability issues. Later the backend will be used to connect players for multiplayer matches.
